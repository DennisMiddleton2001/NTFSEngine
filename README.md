# FSReflector
NTFS File System Reflector

This DLL exports functions that allow low level analysis of the NTFS file system without mounting the actual volume.  It works entirely on DASD and bypasses all file system security.  This also allows analysis of VSS differential shadow copies that wouldn't normally be accessible through conventional tools.  This is the equivalent of file system God Mode!
